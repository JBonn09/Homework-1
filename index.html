                <p>Hi, my name is Jiovanni and I'm really excited about learnng a lot more about coding. I enjoyed working on this project I had a lot of fun 
                    turning a blank page into what I would call art. I also enjoyed figuring out where I went wrong and correcting the problem on my own I felt like I achieved something in life lol.
                    Moving on to other things about myself, I like to travel, play basketball, excersise, I enjoy a great Comic or Comdey and most of all.. I'm a gamer. I love myself a solid 3 hours of uninterrupted video gaming! Speaking of 3
                  heres my top 3 games of all time. ZELDA: Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild and Skyrim. Well.. I could go on and on about lots more but I wont hold you up.  </p>
